Sahewala, learned counsel, appearing for the appellant. Also heard Mr.\nP. Mahanta, learned counsel, for the respondent No.2. However, there was no representation on\nbehalf of respondent Nos. 1] and 3.\n2. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 16-11-2018 passed by the\nlearned District Commission, Kamrup, at Guwahati, in C.C. Case No. 76/2009 whereby the\nlearned Commission below directed the opposite party Nos. 1,2, 3 and 5 to pay Rs. 50,000/- as\ncompensation to the complainant.\n3; Being highly aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and order, the opposite party\nNos. 1,2 and 3 as appellants have preferred this appeal on the grounds mentioned in the appeal\nmemo.\n4, The complainant's case as embedded in the complaint petition is that the opposite party\nNo. 1 is a multinational company, carrying the business of manufacturing and selling beverages,\nnamely, Coca-Cola, Thumps Up, Sprite, Limca, Fanta ete and the opposite party No. 2 is the\nbranch office of opposite party No. 1. Opposite Party No. 3 is the manufacturer of beverages\nand the opposite party No. 4 is the distributor appointed by the opposite party No. 1. Opposite\nparty No. 5 is a restaurant and retailer of opposite party No. 1 at Guwahati. On 22-07-2009,\nthe complainant went to opposite party No. 5 restaurant in the evening hours to have some light\nrefreshment and purchased one bottle of Sprite (RGD) from the opposite party No. 5. The bottle\nwas served to her without opening the sealed cover and when she attempted to open the bottle\nwith a bottle opener she saw a dead fly inside bottle and then she immediately informed the\n\nmatter to the owner of the restaurant and the brother of the owner of opposite party No. 5\n\finformed one of the officials of opposite party No. 2 company over phone. The opposite party\nNo. 2 assured to send official on the next day and asked to give her another bottle and to keep\nthe bottle with the dead fly at the restaurant. But the complainant being enraged by their\nresponse took away the bottle with her to home without opening the bottle. On the next day the\ncomplainant went to opposite party No. 5 restaurant again to meet the official of the opposite\nparty No. 2 but they failed to give any concrete reason as to why that had happened rather\ntried to convince the complainant that the bottle might have been tempered. On the date of\npurchasing the bottle the complainant suffered from convulsion like feeling, mental and physical\nagony which continued till the date of filing of the complaint. The alleged product which is a\nproduct of reputed company, are consumed by majority of people so the manufacturer should\ntake responsibility to maintain quality standard and make it hazard free, but the manufacturer\nfailed to maintain so the opposite party caused deficiency of service also caused mental\nand physical harassment to the complainant. Hence this case for compensation.\n\n5. The pleadings of the opposite parties is that the case is filed by the complainant\nfabricating a story which is totally misconceived. The complainant is not a consumer in respect of\nthe said bottle as the complainant has no evidence that she got the said bottle on payment of\nconsideration. The complainant failed to mention the batch number and other details of the\nproducts purchased by her. It is highly improbable that the restaurant took Rs. 15/- as the price\nof the bottle is only Rs. 10/-.\n\né. In the joint written statement of the opposite party Nos. 1,2 and 3 respectively stated that\nthe complainant had not suffered any physical injury due to the purchase of the imputed bottle.\nThis version of the opposite party Nos. 1,2 and 3 is clear admission of the plea of the\n\ncomplainant regarding the incident on the relevant date.\n\f~~\n\nrc The learned Commission below rightly held that the said admission of the opposite party\nNos. 1, 2 and 3 proves the plea of the complainant. The opposite party has not applied in the\nCommission below for analysing the contents of the bottle. In such a situation for non examination\nof the contents of the bottle it is not fatal to the case of the complainant.\n\n8. After going through the evidence on record it is found that the complainant did not\nconsume the sprite bottle after seeing a dead fly inside the bottle. Though the opposite party\nNos. 1,2 and 3 admitted that on the date of incident the complainant visited the restaurant on 22-\n07-2009 and purchased a bottle of sprite and when she tried to open the bottle she saw a dead\nfly in the bottle. But the complainant had not suffered any physical injury owning to the purchased\nof the bottle. She has not narrated how she suffered mental agony since she had not consumed\nthe same.\n\n9. The learned Commission below after considering the facts and evidence on record\nallowed the complaint and directed the opposite parties to pay Rs. 50,000/- (Rupees fifty\nthousand) with 12% interest to the complainant.\n\n10. In the result the judgment and order passed by the learned Commission below is upheld to\nthe extent of deficiency of service of the appellants. But we are of the opinion that Rs. 50,000/-\nand 12% interest are on higher side. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we are\nof the opinion that it will be just and proper if we modify the compensation amount. So we,\ngranted Rs. 5000/- (Rupees five thousand) to the complainant instead of Rs. 50,000/- as\ncompensation in total. The opposite parties are directed to pay Rs. 5000/- to the complainant\nwith interest at the rate of 6% per annum. The amount shall be deposited by the appellants to the\nrespondent No. 1 within a period of 4 (four) weeks from today before the learned Commission\n\nbelow.\n\f11. Statutory amount of Rs. 25,000/- deposited by the appellant at the time of filing the\n\nappeal, shall be returned to the appellant or their authorized agent on proper identification.\n[2 Send back the LCR along with a copy of this judgment to the learned Commission below,\nKamrup at Guwahati.\n\n( AN\nTu” ty be\n\nMEMBER MEMBER PRESIDENT\n",

            "## Summary of the Case: Coca Cola India Ltd. vs. Deepali Sharma\n\n**Main Features:**\n\n* **Consumer Complaint:** Deepali Sharma (Respondent 1) purchased a bottle of Sprite from a restaurant (Respondent 5) owned by Coca-Cola distributors (Respondent 4).\n* **Dead Fly Found:** Upon attempting to open the bottle, Sharma discovered a dead fly inside, prompting her to contact Coca-Cola (Appellants).\n* **Coca-Cola Response:**  The company initially assured Sharma they would send an official, but later claimed the bottle might have been tampered with.\n* **Compensation Sought:** Sharma filed a complaint for compensation, alleging deficiency of service, mental and physical harassment.\n* **District Commission Ruling:** The District Commission ruled in favor of Sharma, ordering the appellants to pay Rs. 50,000/- with 12% interest.\n* **Appeal:** Coca-Cola appealed the ruling, arguing the case was fabricated, lacking evidence, and the compensation was excessive.\n* **State Consumer Commission Ruling:** The State Consumer Commission upheld the District Commission's finding of deficiency of service but reduced the compensation to Rs. 5,000/- with 6% interest. \n\n**Overview:**\n\nThe case revolves around a consumer's complaint alleging product contamination and poor customer service by Coca-Cola. The State Consumer Commission found Coca-Cola deficient in its service but determined the original compensation amount was excessive, reducing it significantly. \n\n**Suggestions to Win the Case (for Coca-Cola):**\n\n* **Strengthen Evidence:** Coca-Cola should have provided stronger evidence to support its claim of tampering, such as a thorough analysis of the bottle and its contents. \n* **Address Complaint Promptly:**  A more proactive and apologetic response to Sharma's initial complaint could have potentially avoided the case altogether.\n* **Focus on Mental Distress:** The company should have presented evidence to refute Sharma's claim of mental distress. \n* **Offer Alternative Compensation:**  A more substantial apology or a goodwill gesture might have been more persuasive than a legal battle.\n\n**Missed Points:**\n\n* **Impact on Brand Image:**  The case drew negative attention to Coca-Cola's brand image, which could have been minimized with a more effective response. \n* **Product Recall:**  A potential issue was not addressed -  if the discovery of a dead fly in the bottle represented a larger contamination problem, Coca-Cola should have considered a product recall to prevent further incidents.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis case serves as a reminder of the importance of proactive consumer service and the potential impact of negative experiences. Coca-Cola could have minimized the negative outcome by addressing the situation more effectively. \n",

Ali was killed.\nTwo cases, one crime No.169/2007 under Section 304 and 308\nIPC and another case crime No.170/2007 under Section 25 of\n\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally signed by\nAnita Malhotra\nDate: 2023.11.21\n12:37:18 IST\nReason:\n\nArms Act, 1959 were registered against the accused Nanhe.\n\nPage 1 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\n3.\n\nBoth the cases were clubbed and were tried as Sessions Trial\nNos. 1097 of 2007 and 1212 of 2007 by Special Judge,\nS.C./S.T.(P.A.) Act,1989.\n\nThe trial court vide judgment and\n\norder dated 14.05.2010 held the accused Nanhe to be guilty of\nan offence under Section 302 IPC and sentenced him to life\nimprisonment with fine of Rs.5000/- and in the event of default\nin payment of fine to undergo additional one year of\nimprisonment. The trial court also held the accused to be guilty\nfor an offence under Section 25 of the Arms Act and imposed\npunishment of two years of rigorous imprisonment with fine of\nRs.1000/-.\n4.\n\nThe judgment and order of conviction and sentencing the\naccused was affirmed by the High Court vide its judgment and\norder dated 31.01.2019 passed in criminal appeal No.4474 of\n2010. It may be worth noting that a single appeal was filed by\nthe accused against his conviction in both the cases.\n\n5.\n\nThe aforesaid judgment and order of the High Court has been\nassailed by the accused/convict by means of the present appeal.\n\nPage 2 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\n6.\n\nThe submission of learned counsel for the appellant is that there\nwas no intention of the appellant to kill the deceased. His death\nwas accidental.\n\nHis intention could have been only to kill\n\nMahendra and not the deceased Saddam Hussain.\n\nThe\n\nappellant at the relevant time was heavily intoxicated and as\nsuch was not in a position to even know what he was doing.\nThe case would therefore, fall under Part II of Section 304 IPC\nand not under Section 302 IPC.\n7.\n\nThe informant, Mohd. Ali lodged a written FIR at police station\nMoosajhag, district- Badaun on 30.05.2007 stating that on the\nsaid date at about 3:30 p.m. he was going from home to the\nshop of Sant Ram for purchasing some domestic items along\nwith his son, Saddam Hussain (deceased). When he reached\nthe shop, he saw Mahendra and Nanhe (appellant) quarrelling\nwith each other. Sant Ram, who is none other than the brother\nof Mahendra intervened and asked Nanhe (appellant) to leave\nthe place. On this, Nanhe (appellant) left but after walking 15\nto 20 steps from there, he turned around and with his country\n\nPage 3 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nmade pistol fired a shot which piercing the neck of the deceased\nhit the head of Mahendra. Nanhe (appellant) was caught on the\nspot. Saddam was taken to the district hospital where he died.\n8.\n\nThere is no dispute to the fact that Saddam Hussain died of a\nfire arm shot received in his neck and that the same was fired\nfrom the country made pistol possessed by the appellant Nanhe.\nThe weapon of offence and the cartridges were recovered from\nhim. It is also an admitted position as established from the\nevidence on record that the single shot fired from the said\ncountry made pistol after hitting and piercing the deceased in\nhis neck had finally hit Mahendra in his head with whom he\nwas having an altercation a few minutes earlier.\n\n9.\n\nOn the basis of the evidence of the eye witnesses though one of\nthem had turned hostile, the trial court as well as the High\nCourt came to a definite conclusion that the appellant is guilty\nof an offence under Section 302 IPC.\n\n10.\n\nThe only aspect which requires consideration by us is whether\nthe said offence is liable to be reduced to culpable homicide not\n\nPage 4 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\namounting to murder falling under second part of Section 304\nIPC in view of the fact that the appellant had no intention to kill\nthe deceased as he had fired with the intention to settle his\nscore with Mahendra with whom he had entered into a harsh\nargument. The other aspect which needs consideration is as to\nwhat would be the impact of the intoxication of the appellant at\nthe time of the incident.\n11. In context with the argument that the appellant had no\nintention to kill the deceased and that he was accidently killed\nthough in fact he had fired the shot upon Mahendra with whom\nhe had a quarrel/altercation a little earlier, it is relevant to refer\nto Section 301 of IPC which reads as under: “301.Culpable homicide by causing death\nof person other than person whose death\nwas intended. -If a person, by doing anything\nwhich he intends or knows to be likely to cause\ndeath, commits culpable homicide by causing\nthe death of any person, whose death he neither\nintends nor knows himself to be likely to cause,\nthe culpable homicide committed by the offender\nof the person whose death he intended or knew\nhimself to be likely to cause.”\n\nPage 5 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\n12. The aforesaid provision is based up on the Doctrine of\nTransfer of Malice or Transmigration of Motive which provides\nthat where there is mens rea of committing an offence, it can\nbe transferred to another. To illustrate the said doctrine, an\nexample could be given of a person who had intention to kill\na person but by mistake kills another person, then he would\nstill be held guilty of committing murder even in the absence\nof intention to kill that particular person. In simpler words,\nif a person has an intention to commit an offence or cause a\ndeath of any person but kills one whose death he never\nintended to cause, he would still be guilty of causing death.\n13. In Shankarlal Kacharabhai & Ors vs. The State of\nGujarat1, this court while discussing the scope of Section\n301 IPC held as under:\n\"It embodies what the English authors describe\nas the doctrine of transfer of malice or the\ntransmigration of motive. Under the section if A\nintends to kill B, but kills C whose death he\nneither intends nor knows himself to be likely to\ncause, the intention to kill C is by law attributed\nto him. If A aims his shot at B, but it misses B\n1\n\nAIR 1965 SC 1260\n\nPage 6 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\neither because B moves out of the range of the\nshot or because the shot misses the mark and\nhits some other person C, whether within sight\nor out of sight, under S.301, A is deemed to have\nhit C with the intention to kill him. What is to be\nnoticed is that to invoke S.301 of the Indian\nPenal Code A shall not have any intention to\ncause the death or the knowledge that he is\nlikely to cause the death of C.\"\n\n14. In a similar case where also, the victim was accidently shot\nthough the firing was intended to cause injuries to some\nother person, this Court in Rajbir Singh vs. State of U.P.\nand Anr.2 held that the approach of the High Court in setting\naside the order passed by the Special Judge solely on the\nground that the firing was not aimed at the victim and that\nhe was accidently injured is completely in ignorance of the\nprovision of Section 301 IPC. The Supreme Court observed\nas under: “We have heard learned counsel for the\nappellant (complainant), learned counsel for\nAkhilesh Chauhan (respondent no.2) and have\nperused records. The only reason given by the\nHigh Court for setting aside the order passed by\nthe learned Special Judge framing charges\nagainst respondent no.2 is that the firing was\n2\n\n(2006) 4 SCC 51\n\nPage 7 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nnot aimed at Pooja Balmiki but she accidently\nreceived the injuries as she was passing\nthrough that way and was hit. The High Court\ncompletely ignored the provisions of Section 301\nIPC.”\nThe aforesaid provision clearly shows that\nif the killing took place in the course of doing an\nact which a person intends or knows to be likely\nto cause death, it ought to be treated as if the\nreal intention of the killer had been actually\ncarried out.\nThe fact that there was no intention to\ncause injury to Pooja Balmiki and she was\naccidently hit can make no difference as\naccording to the version of the prosecution, the\naccused intended to cause injuries by firearm to\nHoti Lal and in attempting to carry out the same,\nalso caused injuries to her. The reasons given by\nthe High Court for quashing the charges are,\ntherefore, wholly erroneous in law and cannot\nbe sustained.”\n\n15. In another case of similar nature i.e. Jagpal Singh vs. State\nof Punjab3, this Court held that under the Doctrine of\nTransfer of Malice or Transmigration of Motive as per Section\n301 IPC, the accused has made himself punishable under\nSection 302 IPC (simplicitor) as he accidently shot a\nparticular person, though, in fact he might have intended to\n\n3\n\nAIR 1991 SC 982\n\nPage 8 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nkill another person and may have aimed the shot at that\nanother person only.\n16. A composite reading and understanding of the aforesaid\nprovision of Section 301 IPC, Doctrine of Transfer of Malice\nor Transmigration of Motive and above cases on the subject,\nit is quite implicit that the appellant herein is guilty of\ncommitting an offence of culpable homicide amounting to\nmurder punishable under section 302 IPC and that the\nintention to kill some other person is not material in as much\nas he had the intention of committing the aforesaid offence\nthough accidently he might have killed another person.\n17. In so far as the impact of intoxication and causing death\nwhile in the state of intoxication is concerned, a reference to\nSection 86 of IPC is relevant which provides for the offence\ncaused by a person under intoxication and incapable of\nunderstanding the nature of his act.\n\nThe said provision\n\nabsolves the accused of committing an offence by reason of\nintoxication and incapability of knowing the nature of his act.\n\nPage 9 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nHowever, for applying the said provision, it has to be noticed\nthat such intoxication has to be administered to him against\nhis will or without his knowledge which means that it should\nnot be a voluntary intoxication.\n18. The aforesaid provision for the sake of convenience is\nreproduced herein below: “86. Offence requiring a particular\nintent or knowledge committed by one\nwho is intoxicated.—In cases where an act\ndone is not an offence unless done with a\nparticular knowledge or intent, a person who\ndoes the act in a state of intoxication shall be\nliable to be dealt with as if he had the same\nknowledge as he would have had if he had\nnot been intoxicated, unless the thing which\nintoxicated him was administered to him\nwithout his knowledge or against his will.”\n19. In applying the above provision, the following twin conditions\nhave to be satisfied.\n\nThe first that the accused was\n\nadministered a thing which intoxicated him without his\nknowledge or against his will. Secondly, the intoxication has to\nbe of the level which incapacitated him of knowing the nature\nof the act committed or likely to be committed by him.\n\nPage 10 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\n20. The above provision of Section 86 IPC had come up for\nconsideration before this Court in the case of Basdev vs. State\nof Pepsu4 and it was held that where no evidence was led to\nshow that the accused was incapacitated to form requisite\nintention due to the influence of the drink, the killing of a person\nwould be an offence of murder.\n\nIn short, the ratio is that not\n\nonly the accused be intoxicated but also the level of his\nintoxication be such as to render him incapable of knowing and\nunderstanding what he is doing or likely to do.\n\nTherefore,\n\nevidence to prove his incapacity to understand the nature of his\naction is mandatory to reduce the criminality of the accused.\n21. In a celebrated case The King vs. Meade5 it was opined that a\nperson charged with a crime of violence may show or rebut the\npresumption that he intended the natural consequences of his\nacts, that he was drunk and that he was incapable of knowing\nwhat he was doing was dangerous. The law was thus summed\nup as under:\n4\n5\n\nAIR 1956 SC 488\n(1909) 1 K.B. 895,\n\nPage 11 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\n(i)\n\nThe insanity, whether due to drunkenness or\notherwise is a defence in a crime;\n\n(ii)\n\nThe evidence of drunkenness which renders the\naccused\n\nincapable\n\nintention\n\nought\n\nof\nto\n\nforming\nbe\n\nany\n\nconsidered\n\nopinion\n\nor\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\nsurrounding facts and circumstances so as to come\nto the conclusion whether or not he had intention to\ndo the said act; and\n(iii)\n\nThe drunkenness of the accused must be sufficient\nto render him incapacitated to form any intention to\ncommit the crime.\n\n22. In the case at hand, though the informant, Mohd. Ali, PW1 in\nhis deposition/cross-examination has accepted that at the time\nof the incident, the appellant, Nanhe was drunk and was in a\nstate of intoxication, and even the SI, PW6 was of the opinion\nthat the accused was heavily intoxicated and he was unable to\nspeak but the fact remains that in even in such a situation he\nwas able to walk properly and had gone 15 to 20 steps away\n\nPage 12 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nfrom the place of quarrel after it was settled to return and fire.\nThis sufficiently proves that he was mentally alert and was not\nincapacitated from knowing what he is doing and what would\nbe its consequences. Once the killing was complete, the public\nhad thrashed and beaten him mercilessly and, therefore, when\nthe SI PW6 examined him, he could not speak. The inability to\nspeak in such a situation would not be sufficient indication that\nthe level of intoxication was so high that he was unable to\nunderstand and take a conscious decision.\n23. In view of the above statements of the witnesses, it stands duly\nestablished that the appellant had fired the shot in the state of\nintoxication which resulted in the killing of Saddam Hussain\nbut there is no evidence to prove that on account of the\nintoxication, he was incapacitated to know and understand his\nactions.\n24. The facts as narrated above would clearly reflect that the\nincident had taken place on account of a quarrel between the\nappellant and Mahendra with which the deceased Saddam\n\nPage 13 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nHussain had no connection. In the firing which probably took\nplace as a result of the above quarrel, the target was Mahendra,\nbut unfortunately, Saddam was killed. The aforesaid killing of\nthe Saddam was apparently not intentional and was rather by\nway of an accident.\n25. It may be true that the deceased may have been killed accidently\nby the appellant in the state of intoxication but there is no iota\nof evidence to establish that due to intoxication he was\nincapable of knowing the nature of his act or that the act which\nhe was doing or likely to do was so dangerous so as to cause\ndeath of any person. Thus, in the absence of such evidence,\ncoupled with the fact that it is not the case of the appellant that\nhe was administered intoxication without his knowledge or\nagainst his will, the provision of Section 86 IPC would not be\napplicable and he would not be entitled to reduction of sentence\nfrom 302 IPC to one falling under Part-II of Section 304 IPC.\n26. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we find no\nillegality in the impugned judgment and order of the High Court\n\nPage 14 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nin confirming the conviction and punishing the appellant under\nSection 302 IPC.\n27. The appeal is devoid of merit and is accordingly dismissed with\nno order as to cost. However, the appellant is at liberty to apply\nfor remission in accordance with remission policy of the State\nin vogue and in the event such power is invoked, the State is\nexpected to consider it on its own merit most expeditiously.\n\n………………………..

            "## Summary of Criminal Appeal No. 2791 of 2023 (Nanhe vs. State of U.P.)\n\n**Main Features:**\n\n* **Incident:** Nanhe (appellant) shot and killed Saddam Hussain during a fight with another individual, Mahendra, on May 30, 2007. \n* **Conviction:**  Nanhe was convicted of murder (Section 302 IPC) and sentenced to life imprisonment by the trial court.\n* **Appeal:** Nanhe appealed his conviction to the High Court, arguing he intended to harm Mahendra, not Saddam, and was heavily intoxicated. \n* **High Court Ruling:** The High Court upheld the trial court's conviction and sentencing.\n* **Supreme Court Appeal:** Nanhe further appealed to the Supreme Court, reiterating the intoxication and accidental killing arguments.\n\n**Key Arguments & Supreme Court Ruling:**\n\n* **Doctrine of Transferred Malice:** The Supreme Court emphasized the doctrine of transferred malice (Section 301 IPC), stating that intent to harm one person but accidentally harming another still constitutes murder. \n* **Intoxication:** While acknowledging Nanhe's intoxication, the Court found no evidence that his intoxication rendered him incapable of understanding his actions. \n* **Insufficient Evidence:**  The Supreme Court concluded that Nanhe's argument for reduced charges based on accidental killing and intoxication lacked sufficient evidence.\n* **Appeal Dismissed:** The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, upholding the High Court ruling and confirming Nanhe's conviction for murder.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the conviction and sentencing for murder against Nanhe, finding that the doctrine of transferred malice applied, and there was insufficient evidence to support the claim of diminished capacity due to intoxication. \n\n**Potential Points to Consider:**\n\n* **Witness Credibility:** The Court's reliance on witness testimony suggests a thorough assessment of witness reliability and possible biases.\n* **Defense Strategy:** While the appeal mentioned intoxication, it didn't mention self-defense or provocation, which could have been explored as potential defenses.\n* **Remission:** The Court's suggestion that Nanhe can apply for remission according to the State's policy highlights the possibility of future sentence reductions.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe case emphasizes the legal principle of transferred malice and underscores the importance of presenting strong evidence to support mitigating factors, like intoxication, in criminal cases.\n",

            "Criminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nNON-REPORTABLE\n\n2023 INSC 1011\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nCRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 2791 OF 2023\n\nNANHE\n\n…APPELLANT\nVERSUS\n\nSTATE OF U.P.\n\n…RESPONDENT\n\nJ U D G M E N T\nPANKAJ MITHAL, J.\n1.\n\nHeard learned counsel appearing for the parties.\n\n2.\n\nIn an incident which took place on 30.05.2007 at about 3:30\np.m. in the market area, one Mahendra was injured and one\nSaddam Hussain, son of the informant, Mohd. Ali was killed.\nTwo cases, one crime No.169/2007 under Section 304 and 308\nIPC and another case crime No.170/2007 under Section 25 of\n\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally signed by\nAnita Malhotra\nDate: 2023.11.21\n12:37:18 IST\nReason:\n\nArms Act, 1959 were registered against the accused Nanhe.\n\nPage 1 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\n3.\n\nBoth the cases were clubbed and were tried as Sessions Trial\nNos. 1097 of 2007 and 1212 of 2007 by Special Judge,\nS.C./S.T.(P.A.) Act,1989.\n\nThe trial court vide judgment and\n\norder dated 14.05.2010 held the accused Nanhe to be guilty of\nan offence under Section 302 IPC and sentenced him to life\nimprisonment with fine of Rs.5000/- and in the event of default\nin payment of fine to undergo additional one year of\nimprisonment. The trial court also held the accused to be guilty\nfor an offence under Section 25 of the Arms Act and imposed\npunishment of two years of rigorous imprisonment with fine of\nRs.1000/-.\n4.\n\nThe judgment and order of conviction and sentencing the\naccused was affirmed by the High Court vide its judgment and\norder dated 31.01.2019 passed in criminal appeal No.4474 of\n2010. It may be worth noting that a single appeal was filed by\nthe accused against his conviction in both the cases.\n\n5.\n\nThe aforesaid judgment and order of the High Court has been\nassailed by the accused/convict by means of the present appeal.\n\nPage 2 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\n6.\n\nThe submission of learned counsel for the appellant is that there\nwas no intention of the appellant to kill the deceased. His death\nwas accidental.\n\nHis intention could have been only to kill\n\nMahendra and not the deceased Saddam Hussain.\n\nThe\n\nappellant at the relevant time was heavily intoxicated and as\nsuch was not in a position to even know what he was doing.\nThe case would therefore, fall under Part II of Section 304 IPC\nand not under Section 302 IPC.\n7.\n\nThe informant, Mohd. Ali lodged a written FIR at police station\nMoosajhag, district- Badaun on 30.05.2007 stating that on the\nsaid date at about 3:30 p.m. he was going from home to the\nshop of Sant Ram for purchasing some domestic items along\nwith his son, Saddam Hussain (deceased). When he reached\nthe shop, he saw Mahendra and Nanhe (appellant) quarrelling\nwith each other. Sant Ram, who is none other than the brother\nof Mahendra intervened and asked Nanhe (appellant) to leave\nthe place. On this, Nanhe (appellant) left but after walking 15\nto 20 steps from there, he turned around and with his country\n\nPage 3 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nmade pistol fired a shot which piercing the neck of the deceased\nhit the head of Mahendra. Nanhe (appellant) was caught on the\nspot. Saddam was taken to the district hospital where he died.\n8.\n\nThere is no dispute to the fact that Saddam Hussain died of a\nfire arm shot received in his neck and that the same was fired\nfrom the country made pistol possessed by the appellant Nanhe.\nThe weapon of offence and the cartridges were recovered from\nhim. It is also an admitted position as established from the\nevidence on record that the single shot fired from the said\ncountry made pistol after hitting and piercing the deceased in\nhis neck had finally hit Mahendra in his head with whom he\nwas having an altercation a few minutes earlier.\n\n9.\n\nOn the basis of the evidence of the eye witnesses though one of\nthem had turned hostile, the trial court as well as the High\nCourt came to a definite conclusion that the appellant is guilty\nof an offence under Section 302 IPC.\n\n10.\n\nThe only aspect which requires consideration by us is whether\nthe said offence is liable to be reduced to culpable homicide not\n\nPage 4 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\namounting to murder falling under second part of Section 304\nIPC in view of the fact that the appellant had no intention to kill\nthe deceased as he had fired with the intention to settle his\nscore with Mahendra with whom he had entered into a harsh\nargument. The other aspect which needs consideration is as to\nwhat would be the impact of the intoxication of the appellant at\nthe time of the incident.\n11. In context with the argument that the appellant had no\nintention to kill the deceased and that he was accidently killed\nthough in fact he had fired the shot upon Mahendra with whom\nhe had a quarrel/altercation a little earlier, it is relevant to refer\nto Section 301 of IPC which reads as under: “301.Culpable homicide by causing death\nof person other than person whose death\nwas intended. -If a person, by doing anything\nwhich he intends or knows to be likely to cause\ndeath, commits culpable homicide by causing\nthe death of any person, whose death he neither\nintends nor knows himself to be likely to cause,\nthe culpable homicide committed by the offender\nof the person whose death he intended or knew\nhimself to be likely to cause.”\n\nPage 5 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\n12. The aforesaid provision is based up on the Doctrine of\nTransfer of Malice or Transmigration of Motive which provides\nthat where there is mens rea of committing an offence, it can\nbe transferred to another. To illustrate the said doctrine, an\nexample could be given of a person who had intention to kill\na person but by mistake kills another person, then he would\nstill be held guilty of committing murder even in the absence\nof intention to kill that particular person. In simpler words,\nif a person has an intention to commit an offence or cause a\ndeath of any person but kills one whose death he never\nintended to cause, he would still be guilty of causing death.\n13. In Shankarlal Kacharabhai & Ors vs. The State of\nGujarat1, this court while discussing the scope of Section\n301 IPC held as under:\n\"It embodies what the English authors describe\nas the doctrine of transfer of malice or the\ntransmigration of motive. Under the section if A\nintends to kill B, but kills C whose death he\nneither intends nor knows himself to be likely to\ncause, the intention to kill C is by law attributed\nto him. If A aims his shot at B, but it misses B\n1\n\nAIR 1965 SC 1260\n\nPage 6 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\neither because B moves out of the range of the\nshot or because the shot misses the mark and\nhits some other person C, whether within sight\nor out of sight, under S.301, A is deemed to have\nhit C with the intention to kill him. What is to be\nnoticed is that to invoke S.301 of the Indian\nPenal Code A shall not have any intention to\ncause the death or the knowledge that he is\nlikely to cause the death of C.\"\n\n14. In a similar case where also, the victim was accidently shot\nthough the firing was intended to cause injuries to some\nother person, this Court in Rajbir Singh vs. State of U.P.\nand Anr.2 held that the approach of the High Court in setting\naside the order passed by the Special Judge solely on the\nground that the firing was not aimed at the victim and that\nhe was accidently injured is completely in ignorance of the\nprovision of Section 301 IPC. The Supreme Court observed\nas under: “We have heard learned counsel for the\nappellant (complainant), learned counsel for\nAkhilesh Chauhan (respondent no.2) and have\nperused records. The only reason given by the\nHigh Court for setting aside the order passed by\nthe learned Special Judge framing charges\nagainst respondent no.2 is that the firing was\n2\n\n(2006) 4 SCC 51\n\nPage 7 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nnot aimed at Pooja Balmiki but she accidently\nreceived the injuries as she was passing\nthrough that way and was hit. The High Court\ncompletely ignored the provisions of Section 301\nIPC.”\nThe aforesaid provision clearly shows that\nif the killing took place in the course of doing an\nact which a person intends or knows to be likely\nto cause death, it ought to be treated as if the\nreal intention of the killer had been actually\ncarried out.\nThe fact that there was no intention to\ncause injury to Pooja Balmiki and she was\naccidently hit can make no difference as\naccording to the version of the prosecution, the\naccused intended to cause injuries by firearm to\nHoti Lal and in attempting to carry out the same,\nalso caused injuries to her. The reasons given by\nthe High Court for quashing the charges are,\ntherefore, wholly erroneous in law and cannot\nbe sustained.”\n\n15. In another case of similar nature i.e. Jagpal Singh vs. State\nof Punjab3, this Court held that under the Doctrine of\nTransfer of Malice or Transmigration of Motive as per Section\n301 IPC, the accused has made himself punishable under\nSection 302 IPC (simplicitor) as he accidently shot a\nparticular person, though, in fact he might have intended to\n\n3\n\nAIR 1991 SC 982\n\nPage 8 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nkill another person and may have aimed the shot at that\nanother person only.\n16. A composite reading and understanding of the aforesaid\nprovision of Section 301 IPC, Doctrine of Transfer of Malice\nor Transmigration of Motive and above cases on the subject,\nit is quite implicit that the appellant herein is guilty of\ncommitting an offence of culpable homicide amounting to\nmurder punishable under section 302 IPC and that the\nintention to kill some other person is not material in as much\nas he had the intention of committing the aforesaid offence\nthough accidently he might have killed another person.\n17. In so far as the impact of intoxication and causing death\nwhile in the state of intoxication is concerned, a reference to\nSection 86 of IPC is relevant which provides for the offence\ncaused by a person under intoxication and incapable of\nunderstanding the nature of his act.\n\nThe said provision\n\nabsolves the accused of committing an offence by reason of\nintoxication and incapability of knowing the nature of his act.\n\nPage 9 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nHowever, for applying the said provision, it has to be noticed\nthat such intoxication has to be administered to him against\nhis will or without his knowledge which means that it should\nnot be a voluntary intoxication.\n18. The aforesaid provision for the sake of convenience is\nreproduced herein below: “86. Offence requiring a particular\nintent or knowledge committed by one\nwho is intoxicated.—In cases where an act\ndone is not an offence unless done with a\nparticular knowledge or intent, a person who\ndoes the act in a state of intoxication shall be\nliable to be dealt with as if he had the same\nknowledge as he would have had if he had\nnot been intoxicated, unless the thing which\nintoxicated him was administered to him\nwithout his knowledge or against his will.”\n19. In applying the above provision, the following twin conditions\nhave to be satisfied.\n\nThe first that the accused was\n\nadministered a thing which intoxicated him without his\nknowledge or against his will. Secondly, the intoxication has to\nbe of the level which incapacitated him of knowing the nature\nof the act committed or likely to be committed by him.\n\nPage 10 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\n20. The above provision of Section 86 IPC had come up for\nconsideration before this Court in the case of Basdev vs. State\nof Pepsu4 and it was held that where no evidence was led to\nshow that the accused was incapacitated to form requisite\nintention due to the influence of the drink, the killing of a person\nwould be an offence of murder.\n\nIn short, the ratio is that not\n\nonly the accused be intoxicated but also the level of his\nintoxication be such as to render him incapable of knowing and\nunderstanding what he is doing or likely to do.\n\nTherefore,\n\nevidence to prove his incapacity to understand the nature of his\naction is mandatory to reduce the criminality of the accused.\n21. In a celebrated case The King vs. Meade5 it was opined that a\nperson charged with a crime of violence may show or rebut the\npresumption that he intended the natural consequences of his\nacts, that he was drunk and that he was incapable of knowing\nwhat he was doing was dangerous. The law was thus summed\nup as under:\n4\n5\n\nAIR 1956 SC 488\n(1909) 1 K.B. 895,\n\nPage 11 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\n(i)\n\nThe insanity, whether due to drunkenness or\notherwise is a defence in a crime;\n\n(ii)\n\nThe evidence of drunkenness which renders the\naccused\n\nincapable\n\nintention\n\nought\n\nof\nto\n\nforming\nbe\n\nany\n\nconsidered\n\nopinion\n\nor\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\nsurrounding facts and circumstances so as to come\nto the conclusion whether or not he had intention to\ndo the said act; and\n(iii)\n\nThe drunkenness of the accused must be sufficient\nto render him incapacitated to form any intention to\ncommit the crime.\n\n22. In the case at hand, though the informant, Mohd. Ali, PW1 in\nhis deposition/cross-examination has accepted that at the time\nof the incident, the appellant, Nanhe was drunk and was in a\nstate of intoxication, and even the SI, PW6 was of the opinion\nthat the accused was heavily intoxicated and he was unable to\nspeak but the fact remains that in even in such a situation he\nwas able to walk properly and had gone 15 to 20 steps away\n\nPage 12 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nfrom the place of quarrel after it was settled to return and fire.\nThis sufficiently proves that he was mentally alert and was not\nincapacitated from knowing what he is doing and what would\nbe its consequences. Once the killing was complete, the public\nhad thrashed and beaten him mercilessly and, therefore, when\nthe SI PW6 examined him, he could not speak. The inability to\nspeak in such a situation would not be sufficient indication that\nthe level of intoxication was so high that he was unable to\nunderstand and take a conscious decision.\n23. In view of the above statements of the witnesses, it stands duly\nestablished that the appellant had fired the shot in the state of\nintoxication which resulted in the killing of Saddam Hussain\nbut there is no evidence to prove that on account of the\nintoxication, he was incapacitated to know and understand his\nactions.\n24. The facts as narrated above would clearly reflect that the\nincident had taken place on account of a quarrel between the\nappellant and Mahendra with which the deceased Saddam\n\nPage 13 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nHussain had no connection. In the firing which probably took\nplace as a result of the above quarrel, the target was Mahendra,\nbut unfortunately, Saddam was killed. The aforesaid killing of\nthe Saddam was apparently not intentional and was rather by\nway of an accident.\n25. It may be true that the deceased may have been killed accidently\nby the appellant in the state of intoxication but there is no iota\nof evidence to establish that due to intoxication he was\nincapable of knowing the nature of his act or that the act which\nhe was doing or likely to do was so dangerous so as to cause\ndeath of any person. Thus, in the absence of such evidence,\ncoupled with the fact that it is not the case of the appellant that\nhe was administered intoxication without his knowledge or\nagainst his will, the provision of Section 86 IPC would not be\napplicable and he would not be entitled to reduction of sentence\nfrom 302 IPC to one falling under Part-II of Section 304 IPC.\n26. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we find no\nillegality in the impugned judgment and order of the High Court\n\nPage 14 | 15\n\n\fCriminal Appeal No.2791 of 2023\n\nin confirming the conviction and punishing the appellant under\nSection 302 IPC.\n27. The appeal is devoid of merit and is accordingly dismissed with\nno order as to cost. However, the appellant is at liberty to apply\nfor remission in accordance with remission policy of the State\nin vogue and in the event such power is invoked, the State is\nexpected to consider it on its own merit most expeditiously.\n\n………………………..

            "## Analysis of Criminal Appeal No. 2791 of 2023 (Nanhe vs. State of U.P.)\n\nThis case delves into the complexities of criminal intent and the legal consequences of accidental killings. Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**Background:**\n\n* **Incident:**  Nanhe (appellant) fired a shot during a fight with Mahendra, accidentally killing Saddam Hussain.\n* **Initial Conviction:**  The trial court convicted Nanhe of murder (Section 302 IPC) and sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n* **Appeals:** Both the High Court and Supreme Court upheld the conviction, rejecting Nanhe's claims of accidental killing and intoxication as mitigating factors.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\n* **Doctrine of Transferred Malice (Section 301 IPC):** This doctrine states that if a person intends to harm one person but accidentally harms another, the intent is transferred to the unintended victim, making the act punishable as murder.\n* **Intoxication (Section 86 IPC):** To reduce charges due to intoxication, the accused must prove that they were intoxicated involuntarily or to such a degree that they were incapable of understanding their actions.\n\n**Supreme Court's Reasoning:**\n\n* **Transferred Malice Applied:** The Court emphasized the applicability of transferred malice, stating that Nanhe's intention to harm Mahendra was legally transferred to Saddam Hussain, even though Nanhe didn't intend to kill him.\n* **Insufficient Evidence of Intoxication:** The Court acknowledged Nanhe's intoxication but found no evidence proving he was incapacitated to the point of not knowing what he was doing.  The fact he could walk and return to fire a shot after the initial fight suggested he was mentally alert. \n\n**Outcome:**\n\n* **Conviction Upheld:** The Supreme Court dismissed Nanhe's appeal, confirming his conviction for murder and the life imprisonment sentence. \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Transferred Malice is Powerful:** This case highlights the strength of the legal principle of transferred malice, which can hold individuals accountable for unintended consequences of their actions.\n* **Intoxication Alone is Often Insufficient:**  Being intoxicated may be a factor in a criminal case, but it requires substantial evidence to prove that it rendered the accused incapable of understanding their actions.\n* **Importance of Evidence:** The case underscores the importance of gathering and presenting strong evidence to support mitigating factors in criminal cases. \n\n**Points for Further Consideration:**\n\n* **Witness Testimony:**  The Court's reliance on witness accounts highlights the crucial role witness credibility plays in shaping a case.\n* **Potential Defenses:** The appeal did not mention any defenses such as provocation or self-defense, which could have been explored.\n* **Remission Policy:** The Court's suggestion of potential sentence reduction through the State's remission policy is a potential avenue for future consideration. \n",
